Here you can find some examples of my writing, translations, and other work. I also do freelance research in or around New York and translation from French and German.

- I recently translated into English many parts of the University of Zurich's <a href="https://www.adfontes.uzh.ch/en/ad-fontes/einleitung" target="_blank"><i>Ad fontes</i></a> project, an online introduction to working with sources in archives.
The translated sections include the interface for the <a href="https://www.adfontes.uzh.ch/en/ressourcen/abkuerzungen/cappelli-online/" target="_blank">digital Cappelli</a> (a dictionary of abbreviations found in medieval manuscripts).

- Since 2015, I've been working with a friend and Americanist colleague on the history of medieval European architecture transported to the U.S. in the 20th century. We've visted about a dozen archives and traveled around the country to figure out how and why a few Americans undertook these massive feats of transportation. We wrote about some of our research for <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/in-the-early-1900s-dozens-of-centuriesold-european-buildings-came-to-america-where-is-medieval-america-now" target="_blank">Atlas Obscura</a>. We've also given several conference papers on the topic.
