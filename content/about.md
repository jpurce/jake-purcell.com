I'm a Ph.D. candidate in medieval history at Columbia University. I also write and translate, which you'll find more of here. My dissertation is about evidence (legal or otherwise) and epistemology in the post-Roman kingdoms of Merovingian Gaul, but this site is mostly for my non- or extra-academic work.

You can find my CV <href="{{ .Site.BaseURL }}documents/PurcellCV.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
